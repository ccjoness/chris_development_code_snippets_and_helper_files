# Chris's Development Code Snippets and Helper Files.

This is where I store and try to organize helpful code that I find myself using often. I also store code snippets that I find useful and want to keep for future reference.

## Getting Started

Languages are organized by folders. Frameworks will be in the directory of the language they use. Each folder contains a README.md file that describes the contents of the folder.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have some sort of development environment set up. At the very least you will need the language's compiler or interpreter installed. For example, if you want to run the Python code, you will need to have Python installed.

I recommend using [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) for Python development as it works with many other languages as well as python. It is free and has a lot of great features.

An alternative to Pycharm is  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for web development. It is also free and has a lot of great features.

I also recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for containerization. It is a little bit more complicated to set up, but it is worth it.
